// The DataVector class is a simple class that represents a vector of double value data.
// It has a constructor that takes an integer argument, which is the dimension of the vector.
// It has a destructor, a copy constructor, and an assignment operator.
// It has a method setDimension that takes an integer argument and sets the dimension of the vector.
// It has overloaded operators for addition, subtraction, and dot product.
// It has a method print that prints the vector.
// It has a method norm that takes a DataVector argument and returns the Euclidean norm of the vector.
// It has a method dist that takes a DataVector argument and returns the Euclidean distance between the vectors.
// It has a method setComponent that takes an integer index and a double value and sets the value of the component at the given index.
// It has a method addComponent that takes a double value and adds it to the vector.
// The DataVector class is used in the kNearestNeighbors function to represent the test vector and the vectors in the dataset.
